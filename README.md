# UQ (University of Queensland) Degree Planner
CRUD app that ensures that you meet all your requirements of your degree to graduate (not legally liable for any mistakes). 
I made it because organizing courses are a PAIN and although this could be (a lot) better (it is my first web app), I'm pretty happy with the result and I learnt a lot.

Broken on mobile because WHO KNOWS 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔❓❓❓❓❓❓.

Made with Blazor WASM + MudBlazor (debugging was awful I should have just used js).

Archiving this because I don't really want to touch this ever again.
