# UQ (University of Queensland) Degree Planner
CRUD app that ensures that you meet all your requirements of your degree to graduate (not legally liable for any mistakes 🙃). 
I made it because organizing courses are frustrating and although this project could be improved (it is my first web app after all), I'm pretty happy with the result and I learnt a lot from this experience.

Intended for desktop browsers 

Made with Blazor WASM + MudBlazor 

Archiving this because I want to move on to other projects. Hopefully someone other than me can find some use out of this :)
